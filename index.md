## Simple guide of how to report with Snipping Tool
Snipping tool is simple and already provided on all Windows computers, therefore it is easy tool to use and report issues or explain ideas. Sending developer images taken with snipping tool is faster than trying to explain the location and issue with just text. Sometimes issues are coming from the different browser / system, therefore they wont even show up on the developer system. Taking a quick image helps a lot, trying to explain problems.

### Step 1


On every windows computer there is Snipping Tool installed. On Windows 10, it is as easy as pressing start button and just typing in "Snipping Tool". See the image below

### Step 2
Once the snipping tool is open, there is new small window on the screen. Main functionality is around the "New" button, this will allow to select the area to take image of screen.
Other functions are:
"Mode", this allows switching between fullscreen image and screen area selector
"Deplay" - Allows to delay taking snippet of screen, this is helpful when trying to take snippet on places where issue occurs only when mouse is hovered over

### Step 3
Once "New" is pressed, the whole screen will have white overlay. Just dragging and area creates a rectangle, this will be area the snipped is created. This can always be canceled by pressing "esc" on keyboard.

**Make sure you include URL bar in the snippet or include the URL as text when sending the image to developer. Having image without context is as bad as having no context.**

### Step 4
After the area is selected, the previously show small snipped screen reappears but with the snippet included. There are also new possiblities, for example marking the spot that needs attention can be drawn on the image with a simple pen tool (shown with the arro). After editing is done, clicking save will open dialog to save the image file.
